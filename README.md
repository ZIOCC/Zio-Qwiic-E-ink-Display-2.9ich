##### Description

An E-ink module is great, how about to make it even nicer? Here we go! Instead of using SPI protocol, we created this I2C E-ink display to join our Qwiic family. So you can just daisy chain this E-ink display just like the other Qwiic modules!

Nothing fancy here, we add a STM32 as the gateway, it can communicate with I2C system, then drive E-ink display to refresh content by SPI protocol.

In order to inherit the ultra low power consuming feature of the E-ink display, we let the STM32 IC go into deep sleep mode (2uA power consuming) and add an I2C chip that is used for waking STM32 up.

Tired of using boring black and white E-ink display? Let’s add a spicy color to it! This is a 2.9 inch Red-Black-white E-ink display with 296x128 pixels resolution.

The red is good, but not always, because of the limitation of the E-ink display technology, the refresh time for Red E-ink display is much longer than Black-White version, this E-ink display refresh time is 12 secs! Let’s hope the technology will solve this soon, until then, enjoy this red E-ink first!
